539 Group Project - Twitter Health

Health data takes many forms across the internet.  An emerging area of research examines health-related data on social networking websites.  Social networks can be invaluable sources of information regarding health attitudes and beliefs at the population-level.  We hope to develop a system to examine these health attitudes on Twitter, utilizing the Twitter API.  This project would examine one specific area of health attitudes/health behaviors as operationalized by specific hashtags (to be decided).  Data will be gathered using the Twitter API, input into a SQL database, and visualized in a user-friendly, intelligible format using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
